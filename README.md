### About Vocultimate
_"All I know is what I have words for." ~ Ludwig Wittgenstein_


Learning English as a second language is hard but rewarding. And in today's connected world, a good command of the English language can open windows to unprecedented opportunities for you. 

I learned English as a second language, and can personally attest to the importance of the Internet. Therefore, I created this repository to gather English learning resources in one place, with special emphasis on the English vocabulary. Now, instead of aimlessly scouring through the cyberspace, you can focus your time and energy into what matters the most: learning and practicing.

It contains curated lists of online dictionaries, and links to word of the day, grammar lessons, etymological sites, and much more.

The English language has been influenced by the scores of languages from around the world. Some popular words form other languages include: Guru (Sanskrit), Safari (Arabic), Cigar (Spanish), Cartoon (Italian), Kindergarten (German), Cookie (Dutch), Karaoke (Japanese), Ketchup (Chinese), Entrepreneur (French), Massage (Portuguese), Chocolate (Nahuatl). But no other language has influenced and shaped it the way Greek and Latin have. A good understanding of Greek and Latin roots goes a long way in making sense of a large part of the English lexicon. You will in these pages, several resources, and lessons on these roots as well, with lots of examples.

I hope you find information presented in these pages useful. Keep learning, have patience, and remember that consistency is the key. This journey will be worthwhile and rewarding in the end.
